# Instructions #

Game Modes that have been tested:  TF2 and FoF

Pick a game and add it to your plugins directory of your server.   You will still need to download translations and extensions in order for this game to work, so do not forget those!

These are precompiled with the most stable version and ready to use.

War3Source is naturally compatible with CSS, CSGO, and L4D2.   We are unable to confirm these.

It is strongly suggested that you precompile your own copy  to the latest version, instead of using precompiled.
